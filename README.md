MatLabMain does the work, if no raspberry pi close you can opt to read in a photo. 
I have added a couple photos  img(random Generated number).png 

If you want, start trying to understand matlab telnet sessions. Does is need to be encoded still?
How do I sign into kawa with login .as?
If we do that we elliminate python but for now ill throw older FullControl files in here with some matlabengine.

also would like to sit down and clean up the Possible shot Script.
